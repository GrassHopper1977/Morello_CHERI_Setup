CheriBSD's nano doesn't have syntax highlighting and doesn't support code folding. You may wish to use another editor on a different machine. The easiest way is to use SSHFS to map the home directory of you CheriBSD user to your local machine. Then you can use your preferred IDE. SSHFD should already be a part of your SSH service on CheriBSD so we just need to connect to it from our remote machines. This, obviously, depends on which OS you are using.

Windows 11
